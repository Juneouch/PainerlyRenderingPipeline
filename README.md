# PainerlyRenderingPipeline
I present an artist-friendly pipeline that permits everyone to create a painterly rendering scene in a 3D world. I extend the conventional painterly rendering methods by solving two problems with the previous techniques.   First, the pipeline provides editable brush shapes and color textures, which aims to eliminate an artificial appearance.  Second, the pipeline treats characters and landscape as different Shaders, so the artists have more control over focal objects and non-focal objects. The powerful pipeline gives artists enough freedom to adjust visual elements. By adjusting the parameters in the software, we can create many different impressionism painterly styles.  I demonstrate the method by creating a replication of Woman with a Parasol by Claude Monet.
